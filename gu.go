/*
Package gu is a general way of structuring concurrent Go programs
so that most of the logic is contained in pure functions, that is,
functions that don't contain any IO and are easier to test.

The main ideas are:

1. All the program state is kept in one struct.

2. IO functions contain as little logic as possible. Logic is kept
in non-IO functions so it can be tested easily. There is a single
channel for all IO input. When a new message is put in the channel,
the main loop takes it out and uses it and a pure function to update
the global state and trigger new IO actions.

3. Sequential IO is handled by accumulating information in the global
state struct, and updating it when new IO messages come in.

	// message comes in from the outside world and doesn't affect
	// one of the Waiters. So it shouldn't be used when the message
	// needs to trigger a whole sequence of IO actions that depend
	// on each other. In that case create a Waiter.
	//
	// Each new message that comes in is first offered to the
	// Waiters. If none of them want it then it is processed using
